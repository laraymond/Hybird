How to run
---

- In the terminal, navigate to the project root folder
- run 'java -jar sensor-all-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar'

the JAR will look for the 'points_file.xyz' and 'imu.wxyz' and generate a file result of the fusion between the two sensors synchronized. 

The output will be saved in a file named 'ptcloud-rotated-yyyy-mm-dd-HH:mm:ss'
